# Alpaca_python_wrapper
An attempt to make a custom python wrapper for alpaca in python based on LangChain docs 

ref: https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/llms/examples/custom_llm.html

 currently broken


to even try this u need to get prebuild libraries and corresponding weight files  from:
https://github.com/antimatter15/alpaca.cpp 

the weight i am using is provided from: 
https://huggingface.co/chavinlo/alpaca-native 

The script is made so that all the files should be in the same folder
